### Supported Interfaces

The resolver implements `supportsInterface` (EIP-165) for:

- `text(bytes32, string)`
- `contenthash(bytes32)`
- `pubkey(bytes32)`

## Universal Resolver

The Universal Resolver (`UniversalResolver.sol`) is a utility contract that simplifies resolution by finding the correct resolver and querying it in a single multicall.

- **Address**: `0xc5Ed1fA34AD1F23F0cD2E36DB288290488B1B493`

### Usage

Most client libraries (Viem, Ethers) use this contract under the hood to resolve names efficiently.
