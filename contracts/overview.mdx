Namoshi is a decentralized identity system built on top of the Citrea blockchain. It consists of several interconnected smart contracts that handle registration, resolution, and name management.

## Core Contract Addresses

These are the official Namoshi contracts deployed on **Citrea Mainnet (Chain ID: 4114)**.

| Contract | Address |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Namoshi Registry** | `0x9fA2e2370dF8014EE485172bF79d10D6756034A8` |
| **Universal Resolver** | `0xc5Ed1fA34AD1F23F0cD2E36DB288290488B1B493` |
| **Base Registrar** | `0xDB814a8C706e040F6615F37509ae3a38721577e8` |
| **ETH Registrar Controller** | `0xa08728ca65b6b980059dB463AD2714dfffa848cf` |
| **Name Wrapper (ERC-1155)** | `0xd141a197c8A68D9175C201229ae3bf5a7972e8b1` |
| **Public Resolver** | `0x716342C3231A50B55522F16f55ed76B5Bf29df76` |
| **Reverse Registrar** | `0xD896Bee053683f1fd12e549c80F6393494AE243f` |

## Technical Architecture

The Namoshi system is designed to be highly modular and upgradable.

1.  **Registry**: The single source of truth for ownership and resolver mappings.
2.  **Registrars**: Specialized contracts that own top-level domains (like `.btc` and `.citrea`) and issue subdomains to users.
3.  **Resolvers**: Standardized contracts that store the actual data (addresses, text records, avatars) associated with a name.
4.  **Name Wrapper**: A layer on top of the registry that enables advanced features like ERC-1155 compatibility and permission fuses.
