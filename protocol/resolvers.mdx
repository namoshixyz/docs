Resolvers are responsible for the actual process of translating names into addresses. Any contract that implements the relevant standards may act as a resolver in Namoshi.

## Interface

Resolvers are specified in [EIP-137](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-137). A resolver must implement the following method:

```solidity
function supportsInterface(bytes4 interfaceID) constant returns (bool);
```

This function allows users to determine if a resolver supports a particular record type.

## Record Types

The Namoshi Public Resolver (`PublicResolver.sol`) supports the following record types:

### Citrea (EVM) Address

Resolvers must implement the `addr` function to return the Citrea address associated with a name.

```solidity
function addr(bytes32 node) constant returns (address ret);
```

### Other Cryptocurrency Addresses

Resolvers may implement the `addr` function to return the address of other cryptocurrencies associated with a name, as specified in [EIP-2304](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2304).

```solidity
function addr(bytes32 node, uint coinType) constant returns (bytes memory ret);
```

### Content Hash

Resolvers may implement the `contenthash` function to return a content hash associated with a name, as specified in [EIP-1577](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1577).

```solidity
function contenthash(bytes32 node) constant returns (bytes memory ret);
```

### Text Records

Resolvers may implement the `text` function to return text records associated with a name, as specified in [EIP-634](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-634).

```solidity
function text(bytes32 node, string key) constant returns (string memory ret);
```

### Name Interface

Resolvers may implement the `name` function to return the name associated with a reverse record, as specified in [EIP-181](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-181).

```solidity
function name(bytes32 node) constant returns (string memory ret);
```

### ABI Interface

Resolvers may implement the `ABI` function to return the ABI associated with a name, as specified in [EIP-205](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-205).

```solidity
function ABI(bytes32 node, uint256 contentTypes) constant returns (uint256, bytes memory);
```

### Pubkey Interface

Resolvers may implement the `pubkey` function to return the public key associated with a name, as specified in [EIP-619](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/619).

```solidity
function pubkey(bytes32 node) constant returns (bytes32 x, bytes32 y);
```
