Reverse resolution allows applications to display human-readable Namoshi names instead of hexadecimal addresses.

## Primary Names

A "Primary Name" (or reverse record) is the name that an address identifies as its main identity. 

## Retrieving Primary Names

### Using Wagmi

The `useEnsName` hook is the simplest way to find the primary name for an address.

```javascript
import { useEnsName } from 'wagmi'

export const DisplayName = ({ address }) => {
  const { data: name } = useEnsName({
    address,
    chainId: 4114,
  })

  return <div>{name || address}</div>
}
```

### Using Viem

```javascript
const name = await client.getEnsName({
  address: '0x123...abc',
})
```

## Why call it "Primary Name"?

While an address can own many names, it can only have **one** primary name at a time. This ensures that when someone sees your address in a leaderboard or wallet, they always see the same consistent identity.
