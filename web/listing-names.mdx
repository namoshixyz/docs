description: "How to list all names owned by an address"
---

Listing all names owned by an address is not natively supported by the core Namoshi contracts. Instead, we recommend using the [Namoshi Subgraph](/web/subgraph) for efficient querying.

## Using the Subgraph

The Namoshi Subgraph indexes all registration and transfer events, making it easy to query names by owner. For endpoints and full schema details, see the [Subgraph Documentation](/web/subgraph).

### GraphQL Query

```graphql
query GetNamesByOwner($owner: String!) {
  domains(where: { owner: $owner }) {
    name
    labelName
    createdAt
    expiryDate
  }
}
```

## Using the Name Wrapper

If the names are wrapped via the `NameWrapper.sol`, they are standard ERC-1155 tokens. You can use standard token indexing services or the `balanceOf` and `transfer` events to track ownership of wrapped names.

## Client-Side Considerations

If you are building a profile page, you should:
1. Fetch the list of names from the Subgraph.
2. Filter out expired names.
3. Check which name is set as the **Primary Name**.
