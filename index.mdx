## The Identity Protocol for Citrea

Namoshi isn't just a naming service; it's the foundation for decentralized identity on Citrea. By mapping complex addresses to simple names, we enable a more social and accessible Web3 experience.

    Every Namoshi name can be wrapped as an ERC-1155 NFT, allowing for subdomain management and advanced permission controls through fuses.
